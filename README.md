# EasyShop Capstone Project

## Description of the Project

EasyShop is a fully functional e-commerce website with a Spring Boot API backend and a MySQL database for data storage. 
It allows users to log in, browse products in various categories and prices, add them to a shopping cart, and check out to order the products. 
The project involves fixing existing bugs in the API code and implementing new features, all while ensuring the backend functions smoothly.
