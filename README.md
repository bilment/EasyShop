## Description of the Project

The Car Dealership Management System is a Java-based application designed to streamline the management of car dealership inventory and operations. 
It provides functionalities for managing vehicle categories, searching for products, and handling administrative tasks like adding, updating, and deleting vehicles and categories. 
The project integrates Spring Boot for REST API development and uses a MySQL database for data persistence.
